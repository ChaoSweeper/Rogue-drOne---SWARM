### Project Goals
1. Create a small, inexpensive drone
   * This will be done using a mix of 3D printed parts and commonly available parts
2. Autonomous drone flight with image tracking
   * Implement the algorithms required to achieve this
3. Render 3D models from the images
   * Fully rendered 3D model from the images gathered by the drone
    
### Project Scratch Goals
1. Build multiple drones.
2. Network the drones to create a swarm.
3. Drone swarms work together to gather images for rendering

### Project Phases 
#### Phase 1 - Fall semester of 2020.
#### Phase 2 - Spring semester of 2021. 
On the Projects tab, phases will be tracked as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 to clearly mark what phase
of the overall project they fall under.
