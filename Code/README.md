#### Setup
   - Create a virtual environment using the Python built-in virtual environment manager ```venv```.
 
      1. In a terminal window, create a new venv in the folder you will be using for this project. Type ``` py -m venv env ``` in the terminal, with ```env``` being the name of your environment; this can be whatever you want. 


      2. Use the ```cd``` command to navigate to the newly created folder containing the venv. 
      
        
      3.  From with-in the new venv use the following command to activate the venv ```.\env\Scripts\activate```
      
        
      4. Now you can clone the project repository, use ```git clone https://github.com/ChaoSweeper/Rogue-drOne-SWARM/ ```
